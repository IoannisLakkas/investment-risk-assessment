Investment Profile Assessment Script

This script asks the user a series of questions to determine their investment risk tolerance.
Based on the user's responses, it categorizes their risk tolerance and provides investment
suggestions accordingly, including value stocks, growth stocks, bonds, and a 60/40 portfolio.

Usage:
    Run the script and answer the questions with a number between 1 and 10.
    The script will categorize your risk tolerance and suggest appropriate investments.
